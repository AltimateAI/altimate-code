# dbt_shopify v0.13.2
[PR #89](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/89) includes the following changes:

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the `shopify__customers` model incorrectly displayed NULL values for the `customer_tags` field for customers without orders. Updated the logic to ensure customer tags are retrieved even if no orders have been placed for that customer.

## Under the Hood
- Updated seed data to include customers without orders, verifying that their tags are correctly pulled through.
- Added consistency and integrity tests for the `shopify__customers` model to ensure accurate handling of customer tags for all customers.

# dbt_shopify v0.13.1
[PR #87](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/87) includes the following changes:

## Bug Fixes
- Coalesces the `backfill_lifetime_sums` fields from incremental loads, as well as `cohort_month_number` in the rare cases there are no orders from an incremental period. This fixes the issue of NULL values in the lifetime columns in `shopify__customer_cohorts` table. ([PR #86](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/86)).

## Under the Hood:
- Added consistency and integrity tests within `integration_tests` for the `shopify__customer_cohorts` model. ([PR #87](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/87)).

# dbt_shopify v0.13.0
[PR #83](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/83) includes the following changes:

## Features
- Addition of the `shopify__line_item_enhanced` model. This model constructs a comprehensive, denormalized analytical table that enables reporting on key revenue, customer, and product metrics from your billing platform. It’s designed to align with the schema of the `*__line_item_enhanced` model found in Shopify, Recharge, Stripe, Zuora, and Recurly, offering standardized reporting across various billing platforms. To see the kinds of insights this model can generate, explore example visualizations in the [Fivetran Billing Model Streamlit App](https://fivetran-billing-model.streamlit.app/). Visit the app for more details.
  - This model is currently disabled by default. You may enable it by setting the `shopify__standardized_billing_model_enabled` as `true` in your `dbt_project.yml`.

## Under the Hood:
- Added consistency test within integration_tests for the `shopify__line_item_enhanced` model.

# dbt_shopify v0.12.2

[PR #84](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/84) includes the following changes:

## Feature
- Introduced the variable `shopify__calendar_start_date` to `shopify__calendar` to allow for the start date to be customized. This can be set in your `dbt_project.yml`. If not used, the default will start at `2019-01-01`. See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/blob/main/README.md#Change-the-calendar-start-date) for more details. 

# dbt_shopify v0.12.1

## 🪲 Bug Fixes 🪛
- Added support for a new `delayed` fulfillment event status from Shopify. This produces a new `count_fulfillment_delayed` field in the `shopify__daily_shop` model ([PR #81](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/81)).

## 🚘 Under the Hood 🚘
- Added validation tests to be used by package maintainers to evaluate the consistency and integrity of subsequent model updates ([PR #82](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/82)).

# dbt_shopify v0.12.0

[PR #76](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/76) includes the following updates: 

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
> ⚠️ Since the following changes are breaking, a `--full-refresh` after upgrading will be required.

- Performance improvements:
  - Added an incremental strategy for the following models. These models were picked for incremental materialization based on the size of their upstream sources. 
    - `shopify__customer_cohorts` (For Databricks SQL Warehouse destinations, this model is materialized as a table without support for incremental runs at this time.)
    - `shopify__customer_email_cohorts` (For Databricks SQL Warehouse destinations, this model is materialized as a table without support for incremental runs at this time.)
    - `shopify__discounts`
    - `shopify__order_lines`
    - `shopify__orders`
    - `shopify__transactions`
  - Updated the materialization of `shopify__orders__order_line_aggregates` to a table. This model draws on several large upstream sources and is also referenced in several downstream models, so this was done to improve performance. This model was not selected for incremental materialization since its structure was not conducive to incremental strategy.
- To reduce storage, updated the default materialization of the upstream staging models from tables to views. (See the [dbt_shopify_source CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.)

## Features
- Added a default 7-day look-back to incremental models to accommodate late arriving records. The number of days can be changed by setting the var `lookback_window` in your dbt_project.yml. See the [Lookback Window section of the README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/blob/main/README.md#lookback-window) for more details. 
- Added macro `shopify_lookback` to streamline the lookback calculation.
- Updated the partitioning logic in window functions to use only the necessary columns, depending on whether the unioning feature is used. This benefits mainly Redshift destinations, which can see errors when the staging models are materialized as views. 

## 🪲 Bug Fixes 🪛
- Corrected the `fixed_amount_discount_amount` logic to appropriately bring in fixed amount discounts in `shopify__orders`. [PR #78](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/78)
- Removed the `index=1` filter in `stg_shopify__order_discount_code` in the `dbt_shopify_source` package to ensure all discount codes are brought in for every orders. For customers with multiple discount codes in an order, this could update the `count_discount_codes_applied` field in the `shopify__orders` and `shopify__daily_shop` models. [PR #78](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/78)

## Under the Hood
- Updated the maintainer PR template to the current format.
- Added integration testing pipeline for Databricks SQL Warehouse.
- Added macro `shopify_is_databricks_sql_warehouse` for detecting if a Databricks target is an All Purpose Cluster or a SQL Warehouse.

# dbt_shopify v0.11.0
[PR #74](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/74) includes the following updates: 

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Added `source_relation` to the `partition_by` clauses that determine the `customer_index` in the `int_shopify__customer_email_rollup` table. If the user is leveraging the union feature, this could change data values. 

## 🚘 Under The Hood 🚘
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.
- Added additional casting in seed dependencies for above models `integration_tests/dbt_project.yml` to ensure local testing passed on null cases.

# dbt_shopify v0.10.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- This release will be a breaking change due to the removal of below dependencies.
## Dependency Updates
- Removed the dependency on [dbt-expectations](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-expectations/releases) and updates [dbt-date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/releases) dependencies to the latest version. ([PR #66](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/66/))

## Under the Hood
- Removed the `dbt_expectations.expect_table_row_count_to_equal_other_table` test that ensured no fanouts in the metafield models. We will be working to replace this with a similar test. ([PR #66](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/66/))

# dbt_shopify v0.9.0
([PR #61](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/61)) includes the following updates:
## Breaking Changes
These changes are made breaking due to changes in the source.

- In [June 2023](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/shopify/changelog#june2023) the Shopify connector received an update which upgraded the connector to be compatible with the new [2023-04 Shopify API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api). As a result, the following fields have been removed as they were deprecated in the API upgrade: ([dbt_shopify_source PR #70](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_source/pull/70))

| **model** | **field removed** |
|-------|--------------|
| [stg_shopify__customer](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify_source.stg_shopify__customer) | `lifetime_duration` |
| [stg_shopify__order_line](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify_source.stg_shopify__order_line) | `fulfillment_service` |
| [stg_shopify__order_line](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify_source.stg_shopify__order_line) | `destination_location_*` fields |
| [stg_shopify__order_line](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify_source.stg_shopify__order_line) | `origin_location_*` fields |
| [stg_shopify__order](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify_source.stg_shopify__order) | `total_price_usd` |
| [stg_shopify__order](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify_source.stg_shopify__order) | `processing_method` |

- Please be aware that the removal of the fields from the staging models results in the removal of the fields in the relevant downstream models:

| **model** | **field removed** |
|-------|--------------|
| [shopify__customer](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__customer) | `lifetime_duration` |
| [shopify__customer_emails](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__customer_emails) | `lifetime_duration` |
| [shopify__order_lines](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__order_lines) | `fulfillment_service` |
| [shopify__order_lines](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__order_lines) | `destination_location_*` fields |
| [shopify__order_lines](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__order_lines) | `origin_location_*` fields |
| [shopify__orders](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__orders) | `total_price_usd` |
| [shopify__orders](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__orders) | `processing_method` |

## Documentation Updates
- The `shopify_using_shop_metafields` variable was added to the Adding Metafields of the README. It was erroneously omitted in a previous release. 
- Documentation provided in the README for how to connect sources when leveraging the union schema/database feature. 
- Removal of the `current_total_price` yml definition from the shopify__orders model as it was not being created in the model. 

# dbt_shopify v0.8.1

[PR #58](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/58) applies the following changes:

## Bug Fixes
- Adjusts the `int_shopify__customer_email_rollup` model to aggregate _distinct_ `customer_ids`.
- Ensures that each order is tagged with the orderer's `email` before aggregating order metrics in `int_shopify__emails__order_aggregates`.

## Under the Hood
- Ensures transaction `kinds` are being read correctly by applying a `lower()` function. 
- Removes unused and potentially problematic fields from `int_shopify__customer_email_rollup`. The removed fields include `orders_count` and `total_spent`, which are actually calculated in `int_shopify__emails__order_aggregates` before being passed to `shopify__customer_emails` (which is unaffected by this change).
- Removes `updated_timestamp` and `created_timestamp` from `shopify__customer_emails`. Refer to the following fields instead:
  - `first_account_created_at`
  - `last_account_created_at`
  - `last_updated_at`
- Incorporates the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job ([PR #57](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/57)).
- Updates the pull request [templates](/.github) ([PR #57](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/57)).

## Related-Package Releases:
- https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_holistic_reporting/releases/tag/v0.4.0

# dbt_shopify v0.8.0

Lots of new features ahead!! We've revamped the package to keep up-to-date with new additions to the Shopify connector and feedback from the community. 

This release does include 🚨 **Breaking Changes** 🚨.

## Documentation 
- Updated README documentation updates for easier navigation and setup of the dbt package ([PR #44](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/44)).
- Created the [DECISIONLOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md) to log discussions and opinionated stances we took in designing the package ([PR #43](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/43/files)).

## Under the Hood
- Ensured Postgres compatibility! ([PR #44](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/44))
- Addition of the calogica/dbt_expectations package for more robust testing ([PR #50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/50)).
- Got rid of the `shopify__using_order_adjustment`, `shopify__using_order_line_refund`, and `shopify__using_refund` variables. Instead, the package will automatically create empty versions of the related models until the source `refund`, `order_line_refund`, and `order_adjustment` tables exist in your schema. See DECISIONLOG for more details ([Source PR #45](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_source/pull/45), [PR #46](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/46)).

## Bug Fixes
- In the intermediate models, we aggregate a lot of metrics and join them together. In previous versions of the package, some order line aggregates were being doubled if their parent order had multiple kinds of transactions, ie a customer used a gift card for part of the purchase ([PR #51](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/51)).

## Feature Updates
- **New end model alert**: 
  - The package now includes customer models that are based on _email_ rather than _customer_id_ ([PR #45](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/45)):
    - [`shopify__customer_emails`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__customer_emails)
    - [`shopify__customer_email_cohorts`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__customer_email_cohorts)
  - [`shopify__daily_shop`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__daily_shop)  ([PR #48](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/48))
  - [`shopify__inventory_levels`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__inventory_levels) ([PR #46](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/46))
  - [`shopify__discounts`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_shopify/#!/model/model.shopify.shopify__discounts) ([PR #47](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/47), [PR #48](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/48))
- Metafield support! This package now supports metafields for the collection, customer, order, product_image, product, product_variant, and shop objects. If enabled (see the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify#adding-metafields) for more details), respective `shopify__[object]_metafields` models will materialize with **all** metafields defined within the `metafield` source table appended to the object. ([PR #50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/50))
- `shopify_<default_source_table_name>_identifier` variables added if an individual source table has a different name than the package expects ([PR #38](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_source/pull/38)).
- Addition of the `shopify_timezone` variable, which converts ALL timestamps included in the package (including `_fivetran_synced`) to a single target timezone in IANA Database format, ie "America/Los_Angeles" ([PR #41](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_source/pull/41)).
- The declaration of passthrough variables within your root `dbt_project.yml` has changed (but is backwards compatible). To allow for more flexibility and better tracking of passthrough columns, you will now want to define passthrough columns in the following format ([PR #40](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify_source/pull/40)):
> This applies to all passthrough columns within the `dbt_shopify_source` package and not just the `customer_pass_through_columns` example. See the README for which models have passthrough columns.
```yml
vars:
  customer_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
      transform_sql: "cast(field_alias as string)" # Optional: If you wish to define the datatype or apply a light transformation.
```

## dbt_shopify v0.7.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
[PR #40](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/40) includes the following breaking changes:
- Dispatch update for dbt-utils to dbt-core cross-db macros migration. Specifically `{{ dbt_utils.<macro> }}` have been updated to `{{ dbt.<macro> }}` for the below macros:
    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

# dbt_shopify v0.6.0
🎉 dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility 🎉
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_shopify_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_shopify_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

- The `union_schemas` and `union_databases` variables have been replaced with `shopify_union_schemas` and `shopify_union_databases` respectively. This allows for multiple packages with the union ability to be used and not locked to a single variable that is used across packages.

# dbt_shopify v0.1.0 -> v0.5.2
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
